## Model construction

We built an individual-based disease transmission and dynamic energy budget model for schistosomiasis infection (SIDEB) of a size-structured *Biomphalaria glabrata* host population and its human infectious parasite *Schistosoma mansoni*. The SIDEB model is informed by two sub models: a complete dynamic energy and mass budget (DEB) model for *B. glabrata*, including energy and mass compartments for *S. mansoni* parasite biomass and a disease transmission model.

### Dynamic energy budget sub-model for *B. glabrata*.      

We outline the energy and mass budget equations for the dynamic energy and mass budget state variables for the intermediate snail host *Biomphalaria glabrata*. All equations are in [Civitello *et al.* (2018)](Civitello, D. J., Fatima, H. , Johnson, L. R., Nisbet, R. M., Rohr, J. R. and Ben‚ÄêAmi, F. (2018), Bioenergetic theory predicts infection dynamics of human schistosomes in intermediate host snails across ecological gradients. Ecol Lett, 21: 692-701). Equation number in brackets refers to the equation references in Civitello *et al.* (2018).      
  
\   
\  

Resource, $F$, growth in the environment (Eq. 1)    

\  
\

$$
  \frac 
    {d F}
    {d t}
    = -i_{M}L^{2}f_{H}
$$

\    
\  
   
where $i_{M}$ is the maximum ingestion rate per individual host, $L$ is host length ($cm$), and $f_H$ is the host functional feeding response.    

\    
\  
     
Host body length, $L$ (growth) (Eq. 2)  

\    
\  
     
$$
  \frac 
    {d L}
    {d t}
    = \frac
      {gY_{VE}}
      {3\chi} 
        \cdot \left( \frac 
        {\kappa^{*} a_{M}e - (m_{V} + m_{R}E_{M}\delta)\chi L}
        {e + g}
        \right)
$$

\    
\  
   
where $g$ is the energy investment ratio per unit of biomass $cm^{3}$, $Y_{VE}$ is yield of structure on host energy reserve, $\chi$ is the ratio of structural biomass to physical length (mg C mm$^{-3}$), $\kappa$ is the allocation of mobilized energy reserve $e$ to somatic maintenance $m_V$ and growth, $a_M$ is the maximum assimilation rate of food converted into energy, $m_R$ is maintenance of infected (damaged) biomass, $E_M$ is maximum reserve (per unit of structural biomass $V$), and $\delta$ is scaled damage density.    
  
\      
\    
     
Scaled host energy reserve, $e$ (Eq. 3)  

\    
\  
     
$$
  \frac 
    {d e}
    {d t}
    = (f_{H} - e)
    \frac
      {a_{M}}
      {\chi E_{M}L} - \frac
        {P} 
        {\chi L^{3}} 
          \left(
          \frac 
          {i_{PM}f_{P}}
          {E_{M}}
          \right)
$$

\    
\  
   
where $P$ is the within-host parasite biomass (growth of parasite), $i_{PM}$ is the maximum mass-specific within-host parasite ingestion rate, and $f_P$ is the parasite functional feeding response.  

\    
   
The $\frac{P} {\chi L^{3}} \left(\frac {i_{PM}f_{P}}{E_{M}}\right)$ term equals the depleted energy reserve of infected hosts by parasites.     

\    
\  
     
Host development, $D$ (Eq. 4)  

\    
\  
     
$$
  \frac
  {d D}
  {d t}
  = \begin{cases}
      \text{if} \ D < D_{R}, & (1 - \kappa^{*})C - m_{D}D \\
      \text{if} \ D \geq D_{R}, & \text{min}[\ 0,\ (1 - \kappa^{*})C - m_{D}D\ ] \\
    \end{cases}
$$

\    
\  
   
where $D_R$ is the maturity threshold for host reproduction, $C$ is the rate of mobilized host reserve, and $m_D$ is the rate of host maturity maintenance.  
  
\  
  
The $\text{min}[\ 0,\ (1 - \kappa^{*})C - m_{D}D\ ] \\$ term allows the host to 'regress' back to a previous maturity stage when volume-specific reserve becomes too low under starvation conditions, i.e. the shrinking and regression starvation rule (Kooijman 2010).      

\    
\  
   
Host reproduction, $R_H$ (Eq. 5)    

\    
\  
     
$$
  \frac
  {d R_{H}}
  {d t}
  = \begin{cases}
      \text{if} \ D < D_{R}, & 0 \\
      \text{if} \ D \geq D_{R}, & (1 - \kappa^{*})C - m_{D}D
    \end{cases}
$$

\    
\  
   
Within-host parasite biomass, $P$ (growth) (Eq. 6)  

\    
\  
     
$$
  \frac
  {d P}
  {d t}
  = P(Y_{PE}i_{PM}f_{P} (1-r_{P}) -m_{P})
$$

\    
\  
   
where $Y_{PE}$ is the yield of parasite biomass on host energy reserve, $r_P$ is the allocated parasite biomass assimilated to new parasite offspring (proportional to parasite biomass), and $m_P$ is the mass-specific rate of parasite maturity maintenance.     

\    
\  

\newpage     
Parasite reproduction, $R_P$ (Eq. 7)  

\    
\  
     
$$
  \frac
  {d R_{P}}
  {d t}
  = \gamma_{RP}Y_{PE}i_{PM}f_{P}r_{P}
$$

\    
\  
   
where $\gamma_{RP}$ is the relative yield of parasite offspring biomass from assimilated parasite reserve.  

\    
\  
   
Host damage density, $\delta$ (Eq. 8)  

\    
\  
     
$$
  \frac 
    {d \delta}
    {d t}
    = \frac
      {\Theta} 
      {\chi L^{3}} 
      \cdot \frac
      {dR_{P}}
      {dt}
        + k_{R}(1-e)-k_{R}\delta-
        \frac
          {3\delta}
          {L}
          \cdot \frac 
            {dL}
            {dt}
$$

\    
\  
   
where $\Theta$ is the intensity of parasite-induced damage to the host and $k_R$ is a constant for the rate of damage repair via reserve depletion. The $\frac {3\delta}{L}\cdot \frac {dL}{dt}$ term is host "dilution by growth": as the host adds new biomass, this reduces the damage density to its overall biomass.  

\    
\  
   
Cumulative hazard for host, $H$ (Eq. 9)  

\    
\  
     
$$
  \frac
  {d H}
  {d t}
  = h_{b}+h_{\delta} \cdot \text{max}(0, \ \delta - \delta_{0})
$$

\    
\  
   
where $h_b$ is the background hazard rate, $h_{\delta}$ is the hazard coefficient, and $\delta_{0}$ is the linear function for damage density.    

\    
\  
   
Host survival probability (Eq. 10)  

\    
\  
     
$$
P(\text{Survival})[t] = e^{-H(t)}
$$
